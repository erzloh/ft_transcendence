# satori

**ft_transcendence** is our final project of **42 Lausanne**. It is an arcade-like website, we called **satori**, that brings together a **Pong** game, a 2-player **Pac-Man** game, and a variety of additional features such as **3D graphics, an AI opponent, user authentication and game statistics**. Particular emphasis was placed on delivering a **high-quality user experience** through a **modern-looking polished aesthetic**, prioritizing **accessibility, multi-language support, and a fully responsive interface**.

## Games

### Pong
The prerequisite for this project was to recreate **Pong** using Javascript. We developed a **Pong** game that fits the website's aesthetic while maintaining the basic **Pong** mechanics. 
An AI opponent is available with two difficulty levels, and we created an **enhanced** game style that adds an active skill and new physics.
A 3D version of the basic **Pong** was also developed to allow users to enjoy the game from new perspectives.

### Pacman
This game has the appearance of the classic **Pacman** but functions as a **catch** game where the **Pacman** player must collect a set amount of points before the **Ghost** player catches them.
Different characters are available for each role, each featuring unique **active skills** and **passive skills** to allow players to enjoy multiple styles of matchups.
Players can choose from six different **maps** in addition to their preferred **theme**, making the game highly customizable.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erzloh/ft_transcendence.git
cd ft_transcendence
```

### Configure the Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
```

Replace the values with your desired settings to log to the database. POSTGRES_PORT must be 5432 and POSTGRES_HOST must be "db". If you don't put a django key, one will be created.

### Launch the Project
Simply run the following command in your terminal at the root of the project:

```bash
make
```
This command will use Docker Compose to build and launch the backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL services inside Docker containers. Make sure Docker is running on your machine before executing the make command.

Now, your application should be up and running on https://localhost ðŸŽ‰!
